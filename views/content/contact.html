  <h1 class="color-primary font-bold text-up font-semi">Making an appointment</h1>
  <p>Please note that all consultations and procedures are scheduled only on an appointment basis. We are unable to accommodate walk ins at this time. Appointments can only be fixed with the personnel at the clinic, either over phone, or email, with the latter being much preferred to avoid ambiguity. Appointments booked on any other portals/ sites will not be honoured. </p>
  <p>Appointments may not be available on days of hair transplant surgery/ acne scar surgery. Appointments for scheduled procedures like laser hair removal or chemical peels, will be blocked and intimated to you ahead. Should you wish to change/ modify your schedule, do let us know ahead.</p>
  <p>One of our top priorities at the clinic is to reduce your waiting time. We have made some good ground in this aspect over the years, but we are aware that this is a work in progress. Also medical situations beyond our control, sometimes end up upsetting the dayâ€™s schedule. However, we do not take your time or ours, lightly, and will continue to try our best to reduce the waiting time. It would be great if you can cooperate with us towards achieving this, any constructive comments in this regard, are most welcome.</p>
