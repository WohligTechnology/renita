              <li>
                <p> We try our best to treat your concern in the best possible way, based on our experience. It is very well
                  possible that we succeed, but sometimes, it is also possible that we may not. While we strive to increase
                  our success percentage, we are unable to offer any guarantee on any procedure/ service / consultation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Many conditions take time to resolve. As much as we would want a speedy recovery, there is only so much that
                  we can push the human body to. Patience and understanding of your skin condition/ diagnosis is truly appreciated.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Some treatments, like non surgical face lift, are spread out over time, and are offered in multiple sessions
                  â€“ this is just how the treatment works. It would be unwise to expect results with a single session! Please
                  do check with the doctor/ nurse regarding the protocol that is suggested for you, before signing up for
                  the sessions/ paying for them.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Pigmentation treatments involve good after care from your end of the bargain. Sun exposure will interfere
                  with outcomes, and you are encouraged to use sunscreen regularly. You are also encouraged to let your doctor
                  know, if you are unable to adhere to the after care, for any reason, so that the procedure can be rescheduled
                  for later.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Hair loss treatments can give suboptimal results, if the recommended lifestyle modifications are not followed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Body shaping treatments, work best when you are able to maintain your body weight within the recommended
                  limits. Our treatments do not, and cannot, replace basic measures like a good diet and a regular exercise
                  regimen. Rather, our treatment complement your efforts, and help you tame the difficult bits!.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> We wish to treat you like family, and offer you a great experience and some good results. It will encourage
                  us a lot if you are courteous and polite to us, too!.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> We are able to accommodate a maximum of 40 patients/ clients in a day. We may be able to accommodate more
                  in the future, but at this point, we feel that the above is a good number, as we do not want to compromise
                  on waiting time and quality.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Please note that you are under NO COMPULSION, at any point in time, to undergo any treatment/ consultation
                  at our Clinic. We understand if you need second opinions, or want to have your procedure done elsewhere
                  .

                  <p>For procedures that involve blocking a time slot of more than 30 minutes, a non refundable advance has
                    to be made to book the slot. This is to avoid no shows/ delayed arrivals, which in turn upsets the schedule
                    of the day, causing delays to other patients/ clients.</p>
