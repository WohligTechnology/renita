                <h4>Smash grafting</h4>
                <p>Smashed skin grafting is a modification of ultrathin skin grafting. The shaved off graft is smashed into smaller pieces and applied over dermabraded donor area. Procedure is simple and quick. The graft size taken is also smaller when compared
                    with ultrathin skin grafting.</p>
                <h4>Hair follicular grafting</h4>
                <p>Follicular units are extracted from the occiput and implanted in depigmented skin involving hairy areas of the body. The pigment match is after repigmentation is good. As the pigment spread is limited from each follicular unit, the grafts
                    have to be closely placed and the procedure is not applicable to non-hairy skin.</p>
